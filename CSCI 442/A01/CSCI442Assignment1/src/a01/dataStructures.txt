Assignment 1 data structures:

Queue<BusThread> northBusQueue: A queue to hold the busses waiting to go north.

Queue<BusThread> southBusQueue: A queue to hold the busses waiting to go south.

ArrayList<BusThread> busBuffer: An array to hold the busses that are allowed to go.
Only the controller thread can place busses into busBuffer, and busses remove themselves from
the queue after they leave the section. ArriveSection() is implemented by the thread waiting until it's put
into busBuffer.
